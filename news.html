  a character actress who appeared in dozens of TV series and feature films and was perhaps best known for her role as Myrtle in NBC’s Superstore, died Wednesday after a long battle with cancer. She was 86.

Porter most recently was seen in her recurring role as Cloud 9 employee Myrtle Vartanian in the May 16 Season 4 finale of Superstore. Fan favorite Myrtle had recently been rehired as new manager Amy’s (America Ferrera) assistant after being laid off in Season 3 and then brought back as a customer-greeting hologram.

Since Season 1, Porter had appeared in 35 episodes of the NBC comedy series, which returned for its fifth season last night. She had not filmed any Season 5 episodes before her death. The ensemble comedy will likely pay tribute to one of its guest-starring MVPs next week.
